                                <p>A long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five Venusians,
                                    very much startled, looked overhead. They were barely in time to see the huge gray
                                    form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which
                                    bore the mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."</p>

                                <p>It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually
                                    given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt
                                    more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to
                                    live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had
                                    passed as life until then.</p>

                        <p>He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what
                            made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the
                            same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but
                            he wasn't.</p>

                        <p>She didn't understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to yesterday,
                            there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today
                            compared to last year, she couldn't see how anything was ever the same.</p>

                        <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his
                            breath. Of course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be
                            able to answer? He put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her
                            texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>

                        <p>Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you
                            purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When
                            you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the
                            games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts
                            it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be
                            much more expensive than the initial gift itself.</p>
