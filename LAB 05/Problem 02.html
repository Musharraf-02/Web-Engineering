        <p id="p1">The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force
            and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still
            managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed
            over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle
            ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.</p>
        <p id="p2">I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at
            this moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and
            is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph
            because it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the
            distraction.</p>
